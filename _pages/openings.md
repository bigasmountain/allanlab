# Open positions

**Note: We currently don't have funding for additional Postdoc and PhD positions. We can only welcome Postdoc if you have a fellowship. Stuents must have a scholarship or be self-funded. We are happy to support you after you apply to our group.**

**For international postdoc: You can apply to the [JSPS International  Fellowship](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-inv_researchers/index.html).** Please contact to us at least two months before the application deadline as U-Tokyo internal deadline is 1month earlier than JSPS deadline.

**For Japanese postdoc: Please consider applying to [JSPS Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://www.jsps.go.jp/j-pd/).** Please contact to us in advance if you are applying for the fellowship.

We are always looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit!

You will have the chance to work on the grand challenges of condensed matter physics, often at the interface of instrumental design and new physics. You will be involved in determining the important and interesting questions, creating and improving instrumental setups, performing measurements, and making discoveries.
