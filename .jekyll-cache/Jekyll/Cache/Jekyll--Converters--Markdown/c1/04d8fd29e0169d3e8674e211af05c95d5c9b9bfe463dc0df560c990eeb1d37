<p>We are always looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit!</p>

<p>You will have the chance to work on the grand challenges of condensed matter physics, often at the interface of instrumental design and new physics.

### Master projects for U-Tokyo students
If you are a Master student at Leiden University looking for a Master project, contact me (or any group member) per email or stop by my office.

### Bsc / Master students from elsewhere
If you are interested in pursuing a Master degree at Leiden University, see [mastersinleiden.nl](http://www.mastersinleiden.nl/programmes/physics/en/introduction). Sometimes, we take master students or summer interns if we get exceptional applicants (this usually means very good grades and a personal recommendation).
