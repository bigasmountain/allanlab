<p>Our overarching goal is â€¦.</p>

<!--

Our overarching goal is to explore and understand new quantum states of electronic matter on the atomic scale. To do so, we use and develop novel spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy (SI-STM) tools to visualize the relevant quantum mechanical degrees of freedom.

Our goal is to build instruments and develop techniques that enable us to address the questions we find most interesting. This is possible thanks also to Milan's broad background with different research themes and technologies: he learned his trade inÂ [Seamus Davisâ€™ SI-STM lab](http://davisgroup.lassp.cornell.edu/) and with [Felix Baumberger](http://dpmc.unige.ch/gr_baumberger/index.html), and later moved as an [ETH fellow](http://www.ethfellows.ethz.ch/) to [Andreas Wallraffâ€™s qudev lab](http://www.qudev.ethz.ch/)Â where he investigated coupled cavity arrays in circuit QED. We further have group members with different background and interests, working together on physics and instrumentation.

Here are some themes and techniques that we currently work on:

-->

<p><strong>Global River Hydrodynamics Modelling (CaMa-Flood).</strong> Global River Model.</p>

<p><strong>Improvement of global topography/geography map for hydrology models (MERIT dataset).</strong> Precise topography data is the key for high-accuracy land hydrology simulations.</p>

<p><strong>Model-data integration for global hydrology monitoring.</strong> Data assimilaion, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Hydrological processes in Earth System Models</strong> Hillslope hydrology in ESM. Coupling with climate models, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Global climate/flood risk assessment</strong> CaMa-Flood based risk assessment.</p>
